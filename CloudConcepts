Cloud architectures:
    Software as a service - SaaS - Cloud-based software applications delivered over the internet (office 365, Azure DevOps, PowerBI, etc...)
    Plattform as a Service - PaaS - Cloud platform for developing, running, and managing applications without managing infra (Azure app service, Azure SQL DB's, etc...)
    Infrastructure as a Service - IaaS - Cloud computing resources (Azure VMs, Azure blob storage)
    On-premise - Traditional IT infrastructure and software hosted locally within an organization’s own servers and data centers
