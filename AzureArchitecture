Hierchy Example:
    Azure account
          |_  Management Group 1
                    |_ Subscription 1
                            |_ Resource Group 1
                                    |_ Resource x
                    |_ Subscription 2
                            |_ Resource Group 2
                                    |_ Resource x
          |_  Management Group 2
                    |_ Subscription 3
                            |_ Resource Group 3
                                    |_ Resource x
                

Availability Zones: 
      Are physically separated data centers within an Azure region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking. 
      If one zone goes down, the others remain operational, ensuring high availability through private, high-speed fiber networks.

Regions and Region Pairing:
      Region (Paired with other Region)
          |_ Disponibility Zone (Paired with other Disponibility Zones within the Region)
                  |_ Resources (datacenter, cooling, and everything necessary to have a server up and running) 
                  |_ Resources (datacenter, cooling, and everything necessary to have a server up and running)
          |_ Disponibility Zone (Paired with other Disponibility Zones within the Region)
                  |_ Resources (datacenter, cooling, and everything necessary to have a server up and running)
                  |_ Resources (datacenter, cooling, and everything necessary to have a server up and running)

        Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as the US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles apart. 
        This approach enables resource replication across geographies to reduce the likelihood of disruptions from events like: 
                  natural disasters, civil disturbances, power outages, or network interruptions affecting an entire region.


        Sovereign Regions:
              Are isolated instances of Azure. These regions may be required for legal or compliance purposes.
              Azure's sovereign regions include US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, and US Gov Iowa, which are isolated instances for U.S. government agencies and partners. 
              Additionally, China East and China North are available through a partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, where Microsoft does not directly operate the data centers.
