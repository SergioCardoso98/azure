OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors:
    Resource type
    Consumption
    Maintenance
        ex: If you deprovision the VM, the additional resources created when the VM was created may not deprovision at the same time
    Geography
    Subscription type
    Azure Marketplace

Pricing calculator:
    The pricing calculator is designed to give you an estimated cost for provisioning resources in Azure.

TCO calculator:
    The TCO calculator is designed to help you compare the costs for running an on-premises infrastructure compared to an Azure Cloud infrastructure

Microsoft Cost Management tool:
    Cost Management provides the ability to quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources.
    Cost alerts
        Budget alerts
            Budget alerts notify you when spending, based on usage or cost, reaches or exceeds the amount defined in the alert condition of the budget
        Credit alerts
            Credit alerts notify you when your Azure credit monetary commitments are consumed
        Department spending quota alerts
            Department spending quota alerts notify you when department spending reaches a fixed threshold of the quota
    Budgets
        A budget is where you set a spending limit for Azure

Azure Policy
    Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as initiatives
    Azure Policies can be set at each level, enabling you to set policies on a specific resource, resource group, subscription, and so on
    Azure Policy comes with built-in policy and initiative definitions for Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring. 
        For example, if you define a policy that allows only a certain size for the virtual machines (VMs) to be used in your environment, that policy is invoked when you create a new VM
    In some cases, Azure Policy can automatically remediate noncompliant resources and configurations to ensure the integrity of the state of the resources
        For example, if all resources in a certain resource group should be tagged with AppName tag and a value of "SpecialOrders," Azure Policy will automatically apply that tag if it is missing

Resource Locks
    There are two types of resource locks, one that prevents users from deleting and one that prevents users from changing or deleting a resource.
    Delete 
        means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource
    ReadOnly
        means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource
